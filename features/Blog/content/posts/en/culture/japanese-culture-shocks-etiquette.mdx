You've memorized your verbs. You've aced your Kanji tests. You arrive in Tokyo, ready to be the perfect student. Then, you try to tip a waiter, and they chase you down the street thinking you forgot your money. Or you eat a sandwich while walking, and notice everyone is giving you "The Look."

Japanese culture is built on **unspoken rules**. Here are the 5 biggest culture shocks for learners, and how to navigate them like a pro.

## 1. The "Walking and Eating" Taboo

In many Western cultures, "grab and go" is a way of life. In Japan, eating or drinking while walking (called **Aruki-tabe**) is generally considered impolite.

**Why?** It's seen as messy and shows a lack of respect for the food.
**The Solution:** If you buy a snack at a convenience store (Konbini), eat it in front of the store or wait until you get to a park or home.

  **Exception:** Standing and eating at a festival (Matsuri) or at a standing
  noodle bar (Tachigui) is perfectly fine!
</InfoBox>

## 2. The Silence of the Train

Japanese trains are incredibly quiet. Talking on your phone is a massive social "no-no." If your phone rings, you'll see people physically flinch.

**The Rule:** Keep your phone on **"Manner Mode"** (vibrate) and avoid loud conversations with friends. Texting is fine, but speaking is for the station platform.

<InfoBox type='tip'>
  **Pro Tip:** This silence makes trains a FANTASTIC place to practice your
  listening on [KanaDojo](/). Just make sure you have your headphones in!

## 3. The "No Tipping" Culture

This is the hardest one for travelers from the US or Europe. Tipping **is not done** in Japan. In fact, offering a tip can sometimes be seen as insulting, as if you're implying the business doesn't pay its staff enough.

**The Rule:** Pay the exact amount on the bill. If you leave extra money, the staff will likely run after you to return it.

## 4. The Complexity of the "Bow" (Ojigi)

Textbook bow: "Lean forward 30 degrees."
Real life bow: It’s a dynamic conversation!

- **Eshaku (15°):** A casual nod/bow for people you know or as a quick "thanks."
- **Keirei (30°):** The standard business bow. Use this for shop staff or strangers.
- **Saikeirei (45°):** Reserved for deep apologies or meeting the Emperor. (Hopefully, you won't need this often).

## 5. The "Trash" Mission

You'll notice something strange about Japanese streets: They are spotless, yet there are **no trash cans.** After the 1995 subway attacks, most public bins were removed.

**The Rule:** Prepare to carry your trash with you all day.
**Hack:** Look for vending machines—they usually have a bin next to them specifically for bottles and cans (not for your half-eaten sandwich!).

## Test Your Cultural IQ

<QuizQuestion
  question='You are on a busy train in Tokyo. Your phone unexpectedly rings. What is the most polite action?'
  options={[
    'Answer it and talk quietly',
    'Answer it and shout that you will call back',
    'Immediately silence it and do not answer',
    'Throw the phone out the window',
  ]}
  answer={2}
  explanation='Talking on the phone on public transport in Japan is considered very rude. Silence the call immediately and text the person later.'
/>

<QuizQuestion
  question='You finished a delicious meal at a local Izakaya. How should you show your appreciation?'
  options={[
    'Leave a 20% tip',
    'Say "Gochisousama deshita"',
    'Give the waiter a high-five',
    'Leave a review on Yelp immediately',
  ]}
  answer={1}
  explanation="'Gochisousama deshita' is the standard way to say 'Thank you for the meal' and is much more appreciated than a monetary tip."
/>

## How to Prepare for Your Trip

1.  **Watch "Day in the Life" Videos:** See how people move and interact in public spaces.
2.  **Learn Basic Social Phrases:** "Sumimasen" (Excuse me) is your magic word for almost every situation.
3.  **Practice Your Numbers:** Being able to count money and understand prices will save you a lot of stress at the register. Try our [Vocabulary Trainer's Number Set](/en/vocabulary/train).

## Conclusion

Culture shock is part of the adventure! Don't be afraid of making mistakes—Japanese people are generally very forgiving toward foreigners (Gaijin) who are clearly trying their best.

By respecting these unspoken rules, you’ll show that you’re not just a tourist, but a **learner** who respects the culture.
